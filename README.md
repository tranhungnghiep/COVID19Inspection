### COVID-19 Inspection

This contains some codes for COVID-19 document analysis. Currently including:
- `covid19_paper_crawler.ipynb`: a crawler to update pdf files of covid-19 related papers.
- `paper_table_extraction.ipynb`: tutorials and helper codes for table content extraction, sequentially and in parallel batch.

Other analyses and applications based on the methods in my research will be released in the future.
